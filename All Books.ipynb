      "Even if you've read this book already, I recommend the audio version, it is so well read. This masterful narrative brings home again the fact that war is hell! Our hero, Louie Zamperini is a track star who participated in the Berlin Olympics, shook hands with the Fuhrer and was an American serviceman in the US air force in  WWII. He was shot down June of 1943 over the Pacific and was adrift with his buddy Phil and fellow servicemen for over forty days. I don't believe this story could have been more meaningfully told by anyone else. The detail is staggering and the emotions overwhelming, this book pulses with the liveliness that attaches itself to every good book. The data that Hillenbrand provides is vivid, starting with the relentless stalking by some aggressive sharks mistakenly confusing the downed servicemen  for food, scorched by an unforgiving sun, and an inescapable hunger they drift into Japanese waters and the hands of some heartless guards. The unspeakable horrors experienced by the POWs made me feel the humiliation, shame and powerlessness they suffered at the hands of a country (Japan) single minded in its pursuit to win at all costs.  The Japanese guards tried and in some cases succeeded in stripping the POWs of their honor, dignity, sense of self and self respect. Every indignity suffered was meant to showcase their absolute and profound wretchedness and to strip them of all hope. Despite the seriousness of this tale, there were still some real laugh-out-loud moments that point to this story as one of redemption and forgiveness. Some acts of rebellion included the incorrigible stealing techniques the men adopted, the codes they used to speak with each other right in front of the guards, the nicknames they invented for them and the explosive farts cultivated and lobbed in the direction of the guards, all the more deadly because of the chronic dysentery they suffered. Then there was Gaga the peg-legged pet duck the POWs adopted, who brought a tidbit of levity up until it's demise. Funny too, the tale of the RAF who flew over the camp to let the POWs know the war had ended, \"a candy bar with a bite taken out of it and a twenty-count packet of cigarettes with one missing. Fitzgerald had the candy bar sliced into seven hundred slivers, and each man licked a finger, dabbed it on his bit of chocolate, and put it in his mouth. Louie's portion was the size of an ant. Then Fitzgerald had the men form 19 circles, each of which received one cigarette. Each man got one delectable puff.\" The honor and dignity of these men would not be denied despite their sometimes fatal run-in with a sadist to rival Hitler, Mutsuhiro Watanabe. Why he was not hunted down and executed with an ending similar to Osama Bin Laden is beyond me. The POWs were powerless in the face of this madman. The author likens the stripping of the POW's dignity to the same conditions faced by the slaves of the American South and the thousands of betrayed people the world over, I second that. There are people who say they read this story and gave the book 2 or 3 stars and in their review question the veracity of Louie's story. I have a sneaking suspicion these are the same people who don't believe the Holocaust happened. Do they think not believing in gravity makes the theory null and void?! Louie's saga makes me more aware than ever that freedom is not free, someone has to put in the plumbing! Our government too has exacted injustices on the men who serve our country. Sometimes keeping families in the dark about their lost loved ones and paying lip service to the sacrifices they have made. Our service men should never, ever, be hungry, cold, lonely, poor, friendless or homeless because of the price they have paid for our freedom. VJ day is now way more significant to me and I see the cost our men paid as priceless. Having made it back to America and finally to a state of wholeness thanks to a merciful God, I can well understand why Louie can end his life flushed with love for everyone and everything!\n"
