utterly alone Mark Watney refuses to give up His quick thinking and smarts help him to devise a plan to try and get rescued Unfortunately the odds are insurmountable Watney faces starvation a hostile environment and he has no way to contact NASA Can some duct tape and ingenuity help him find a way homebrbrWhat I LikedbrI am an eclectic reader but I can honestly say I wouldnt likely have picked up The Martian on my own and I would have totally missed out This is a scifi book packed full of math and science and danger and I absolutely loved it This book was so fun to listen to I was rooting for the hapless Mark Watney and I completely fell in love with his never say die attitude and his unwavering sense of humor Think of this book as MacGyver stranded on Mars Yes even on Mars duct tape is miraculous Trust me even if scifi is outside your normal reading zone you should read this It is so good that a movie is in the works starring Matt DamonbrMark Watney is the star of the show You would think reading an entire book surrounding one guy stranded alone on Mars would be boring but nope its not What makes this book shine is Watneys humor He is always cracking jokes and making sarcastic remarks that help liven up some of the more dry science passagesninja pirates I absolutely adored is comedic remarks his commentary on seventies tv and music was hilarious Most of the book is told via Watneys blog entries where he relates his Martian antics and failures via a computer journal in hopes that someone someday will be able to retrieve it because he realizes his situation is rather dire Yet he refuses to give up Talk about resourceful Time and time again he manages to figure out a solution using math and his smarts Watney actually proves how valuable those algebra story problems can be Loved loved loved Mark Watney Geeky botanist or not he is totally hotbrAfter a certain point the book switches view points and you start getting voices from people down on Earth who are desperate to find a way to save Watney I enjoyed getting inside the heads of the powers that be at NASA and learning about all the obstacles and red tape that had to be dealt with in order to try and save Watney Eventually you even get the view points of his former crew mates I thought the way this story was executed was brilliant and I thoroughly enjoyed all the view pointsbrLets talk about the science parts This is an incredibly realistic and obviously well researched book The author takes us through all the science in what is necessary to survive on Mars You learn about all kinds of fascinating stuff There are lots of passages where Watney explains the science behind whatever he is doing whether it be trying to make water or rocket fuel or even growing potatoes I know some of you are worried that reading all the scientific details would get a bit dry but for the most part it was awesome thanks to Watneys fun narratives Watney spices it up and makes you laugh as he explains things So even if you dont like scifi books with lots of science you will enjoy this one thanks to the humorbrI kid you not this is truly an edge of your seat thriller Watneys life is constantly on the line as he tries to survive one harrowing experience after another He faces insurmountable odds as he battles starvation shelter issues a long arduous journey across Mars to hopefully be rescued dust storms explosions etc It is literally one mishap after another and the reader quickly learns early on if it can go wrong it more than likely will This is an addictive readlisten that you wont be able to put down as you just have to know if he will survive from one predicament to the next and most of all if he will actually get off Mars because trust me when I tell you the odds are stacked against him like you wouldnt believebrThis is a book where I absolutely cant recommend the audiobook enough R C Bray brilliantly narrates this one and he brings Mark Watney to life He is outstanding This is the first time I have listened to this narrator and it wont be my last He vaults his way up there next to Will Patton and Luke Daniels on my favorite male narrator list I think this one is better to listen to vs reading as Bray manages to make all those scientific passages funny I dont think I would have been as engaged if I had read it vs listening If you can get your hands on the audiobrAnd The Not So MuchbrWithout giving away too much I was left at the end wanting more I would have loved to see it extend just a little bitbrFor the most part I enjoyed all the scientific jargon and the explanations Weir manages to deliver it in a way where it is relatively easy to understand but I do admit there were a few times especially toward the end when I was overly anxious that some

Martian is without a doubt going to end up on my best of 2015 list This is a book I would likely not have picked up on my own but thanks to all the stellar reviews I grabbed it and I am certainly glad

\\xe2\\x80\\x9cintelligent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d book it is riddled with technical and scientific details that mentally challenge you to think about what is taking place what might possibly happen and what

far as to crunch down difficult math equations without pen or paper And you unknowingly become mesmerized with it all his natural ability to process information solve equations and overcome

survival prose on Mars You are immediately plopped right into the middle of Mars and then the real mission begins as you struggle to survive in a primitive way  wait am I talking about me or Mark Watney Well in a sense it felt like my mission too because as a matter of fact I was left breathless and wideeyed throughout the entire story as Watney took me along on his wild escapades throughout Mars on a rover no less as well as the hazardous experiments that had me at the edge of my seat It was all so thrillingbrbr It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a book turned movie The cast looks promising but considering Mark Watney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charming arrogance I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help but to think that Robert Downy Jr or perhaps George Clooney in light of his recent role inGravity would have played a better Mark Watney role BUT since we have yet to see the film I will leave my thoughts here and hope that Matt Damon will live up to this fantastic character arc It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be fascinating to see the real lifethreatening moments come to life on film too I seriously cannot waitbrbr3 THINGS I DID NOT LIKEbr At some point in a novel authors are inclined to have to provide chunks of information in order to get the setting mood point across to the reader I understand this however with The Martian the expository of information dumping is exceedingly overwhelming But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a novel situated on Mars Claudia Yeeeaaaaah but no it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a completely different level of scifi friends The way in which Mark Watney explains his arguments observations and theories referencing numerous elements from the periodic table which by the way I vaguely remember within the narrative seriously feels as though you are sitting in an astronomy science class at a university Here allow me to give you some perspectivebrbr \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy best bet for making calories is potatoes They grow prolifically and have a reasonable caloric content 770 calories per kilogram I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m pretty sure the ones I have will germinate Problem is I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grow enough of them In 62 square meters I could grow maybe 150 kilograms of potatoes in 400 days the time I have before running out of food That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a grand total of 115500 calories a sustainable average of 288 calories per day With my height and weight if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m willing to starve a little I need 1500 calories per daybrbr \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe oxygenator will turn it into oxygen in its own time Then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll release hydrazine very slowly over the iridium catalyst to turn it into N2 and H2 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll direct the hydrogen to a small area and burn it As you can see this plan provides many opportunities for me to die in a fiery explosionbrbr \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe regulator uses freezeseparation to sort out the gases When it decides there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too much oxygen it starts collecting air in a tank and cooling it to 90 kelvin That makes the oxygen turn to liquid but leaves the nitrogen condensation point 77K still gaseous Then it stores the O2brbrBut I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it to do that for hydrogen because hydrogen needs to be below 21K to turn to liquid And the regulator just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get temperatures that low Dead endbrbrHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the solutionbrHydrogen is dangerous because it can blow up But it can only blow up if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oxygen around Hydrogen without oxygen is harmless And the regulator is all about pulling oxygen out of the airbrbrSee what Andy Weir does here at the end It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like Science for Dummies First he demonstrates his extensive knowledge in mathematics and scientific notations and then subtlety lays it down for readers like me Yeah this points to head doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to function properly when it comes to science Mr Weir I need visuals illustrations and models of the sort especially with science and math But man you Sir have my respect Still I think a condensed version of information would have been more effective aaand I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stick to Dr Walt Brown he grabs my attentionbrbr Foul language plays out best when it is used sparingly or at least in moderation for this reason it behooves me to say the profanity in this novel was a major turn off for me Okay humans get angry yes and Mark Watney is stranded on Mars thus I can see how he might possibly find it comforting and relieving to stress his frustrations using raw language but what really threw me off was the way in which Andy Weir penned NASA I am not kidding when I say this every single bureaucrat conversed in such a rude ignorant socially unacceptable way that left me feeling no respect for them whatsoever NASA was poorly delivered in terms of character Is NASA that unsteady and illequipped to belittle someone or some event that they must resort to such tasteless abusive words It just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to fit their wellversed

don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about you but when I think of Mars I think of aliens shrugs amp shakes head no aliens here my friends The Martian is actually Mark Watney Clever huh One more thing owing to the fact that the narrative is an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinformation dumping book\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the worldsetting and overall mood fell short for me BUT I still enjoyed the narrative and think

       " 'The Martian took me by surprise If I am honest I have yo say I was ready to give up on this book after 50 pages Its not that I didnt find it interesting enough or well written or even scientifically accurate because it really was all these things I just found it hard to connect with the lead characterbrbr  Mark Watney was not a character I immediately connected with In fact it took me long time to even get to the point when I would tolerate him what with all his jokes and jackass behavior I didnt understand how a person left to die alone on a different planet could be so lighthearted cheerful and in the mood for random jokes It wasnt until I finally realized that had he been any more serious or depressing I would have hated his guts even more Mark made the best out of the situation he found himself in and I learned to appreciate his optimism and zest for life His brave attitude was truly admirable He was a clever problemsolver and in situations where most of us would probably break down and cry he looked for solutions and ways to troubleshoot And his jokes and surprisingly positive attitude Well I realize now that without it the whole novel would have been pointless he mightve as well just shoot himself in the head in the first chapterbrbr  By the end of the book I was a huge fan of Mark Watney and his biting sense of humor He is such a fantastic complex intelligent and sharp character I actually miss his inappropriate remarks and nerdy observations He grew on me like no other character ever did and I wish I knew someone like Watney in real lifebrbr  The concept behind this novel is really rather simple and really kind of brilliant in its simplicity Can you even imagine how incredibly terrifying it would be to be left behind all alone on a planet thousands of miles away from home Knowing that you dont have enough supplies to last anywhere long enough for the rescue mission to come and save you Not even having any means of communicating to others that youre alive Boy I would probably give up and die on the spot the moment Id realize the extent of just how screwed I wasbrbr  The premise was blood chilling in both the concept and its execution Mark is a fighter but Mars itself is definitely a worthy opponent Everything that can go wrong does and its a never ending battle against time and Mars deadly atmosphere The sense of urgency and danger is omnipresent almost palpable and claustrophobic to the point that youre having trouble breathing yourself while reading about Mark running out of oxygen or you suddenly feel the urge to stock up on food supplies while reading about Marks desperate attempts at growing potatoes on Mars and really just how cool is thatbrbr  I loved how scientifically accurate this book was All the scientific detail made this story very believable and therefore that much more terrifying The many bits and pieces of information and data endless calculations and predictions detailed descriptions etc It all made for an interesting read And even though it was definitely a bit heavy on the scientific stuff it was never boring or disconnected Andy did a great job of balancing the intense plot line with the scientific information creating a story that while mentally stimulating complex and challenging was also very entertaining and emotionally engaging And Marks awesomely bada character played a vital role in making this a very accessible and enjoyable readbrbr  I would recommend this book to all science fiction fans especially those who appreciate a great thrilling story with a carefully fleshed out scientific background You wont be disappointed',\n",

       " 'I know there are LOTS of reviews already so maybe mine will just be added to the sea of voices However I feel I should point something out so here is my ranterI mean reviewbrbrSo after reading this book which I read faster than any novel Ive ever readI was intrigued by what others might have thought I for one chalked up my hysterically enthusiastic love for this book to my marsophile way of looking at the world and yknow me being an engineering student and a super nerdbrbrWell I was pleasantly surprised to see so many people did in fact like this book Wow People really DO give a sht about science Yay Ok so I guess Im not saying all bad stuff But I was still frustrated by some of the onestarsbrbrI found a common trend among most not all of the one star reviews The typical complaints I found were thesebrThe book is boringtediousbrThe book is too technicalscienceybrThe writing is sophomoricbadetcbrThe characters are juvenileimmaturebrThe characters are onedimensionalbrbrGo ahead and look at the one star reviews and nearly EVERY SINGLE ONE of them says one or more of those exact thingsbrbrWhy would I be bothered by this Well Ill start with the most nebulous or difficult to counter complaint and move to the most exacting or easiest to refutebrbrThe writing is sophomoric Okay so this one is sort of hard to refute Its true that this is Andys first novel however he isnt exactly new to writing I will absolutely agree that his writing has a VERY distinct style to it and if it just isnt your cup o tea it just wont improve His style is polarizing I think its pretty obvious that he still has a lot to learn about writing but I found his attention to detail and pacing to actually be pretty darn good Mostly he did the right thing in that his writing got out of the way of itself I think a lot of this hinges on the other complaints though If you found the story too technical or tedious then clearly itd be difficult to let the writing get out of the way In fact itd be assaulting you right in the eyeballs in a pretty horrific way and I think thats how it ended up for a lot of the negative reviewersbrbrToo tediousboringtechnical This complaint I find to be highly alarming The technical explanations NEVER exceed anything above high school level Some of it IS specific but not that hard to look up In fact plenty of good writing that is well respected tends to push the readers vocabulary they have to look words up or learn new uses for old words This is NOT uncommon in the world of great literature Andy has chosen instead to expand the readers technical vocabulary And admittedly your technical understanding SHOULD be at a level high enough to understand this If it isnt Id recommend reading it looking up what you dont understand and reading it again If this book is too technical for you then your education has failed you so do better This is like complaining that a race car is hard to drive Well yeah of course it is if you dont know how to drive one driving a passenger car is hardly sufficient enough skill to operate a race car Same principle herebrbronedimensionaljuvenileimmature characters I find this to be most disturbing of all If you GENUINELY feel that these people especially Whatney behaves in a unrealistic way then I feel VERY sorry for people who interact with you I was surprised by the depth of the character study done here I personally resonated with Whatney My wife went as far as to say that he talks just like me So of course I suppose that means many of you onestar reviewers would write me off as juvenile Yikes Spoiler different people have different personalities Mark Whatney is a CLASSIC INTP If you dont know what an INTP is then google it and read it Youll notice Mark behaves VERY similarly In fact Id go as far to say that Andy himself might have this personality type which lends itself well to injecting such passion into the main character and bleeds through into the writing style itselfbrbrLook this is a FANTASTIC book If you are really into the space colonization thing aerospace industry survival stories mars stories and you have a decent enough technical background or dont mind learning what you dont know then this is probably a book you will want to read I think a willingness to be open to both people and details are needed to fully appreciate this novelbrbrNot all the negative reviews are bad some have pretty valid points about Andys amateur status But overall the majority of the negative reviews should be shunned due to their intolerance of those personalities that fail to match their social standards andor general lack of technical competencybrbrI can sum up who should NOT buy this bookbrThe stupid people who cant see the point of math after highschool how is your retirement account coming along lots of numbers rightbrThe vapid selfcentered people who think theyre type of personhood and worldview is the only one that mattersbrOR The person who is a rather competent reader who just happens to not be into this kind of storybrbrBut for almost anyone else who is interested you already know you are so just buy the darn thing already And if youre offended by anything I said in this reviewwell you wont be able to handle Mark Whatney so you might as well NOT buy it',\n",

it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to mean \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Surviving out of sheer dumb luck when everybody believed him utterly lost and well dead Mark has to use every bit of knowledge to make lemonade with all the Martian lemons he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being thrown at And there are a lot from defective materials to his own mistakes Fortunately he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s both an engineer and a botanist which means he does have enough knowhow to improvise as well as try to grow stuff here go the first Martian potatoes Unfortunately he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a chemist or whatever else so he also has to do things through trial and error And while his predicament is absolutely horrible since anything can go wrong anytime it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also funny and awesomebrbrThroughout the story Mark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice is highly entertaining Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a man who was picked for his skills but also for his optimism and sense of humour in the hopes that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be the social glue among the crew\\xe2\\x80\\x94who had to live together in close quarters for the long trip to and fro as well as on Mars itself And I think his way of apprehending his many problems was just as much a lifesaver as his knowledge because even though he sometimes lost it it never lasted for long and he went back to work soon after This may seem weird and unbelievable to some but in a way I could relate to his character although not to a complete extent of course I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the kind of person who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll scream and run in circles for two minutes out of panic then will suddenly calm down and say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOK back to solving that problem now and if I can do so while throwing in some bawdy joke I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I kid you not So yes somewhat unbelievable\\xe2\\x80\\x94and somehow I just couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care less I rooted for that character I wanted him to survive PeriodbrbrSimply put this book was inventive and fun

there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that much in it for them Too good to be true Perhaps But also beautiful a beautiful lesson in how sometimes humanity is still able to unite Not to mention the biggerthanlife side of this novel a coming back to older times to a period when we thought Space was at the tip of our fingers I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a child of the eighties and I still remember my own ideas back then

may not be to other readers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 My own background in that regard isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very developed so I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell if everything was exact at least it seemed to me that

why Mark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s humour The way people banded to try and save him As said above I rooted for him The author made him so likeable I just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about the restbrbrThe shift from 1st to 3rd person It was a little unsettling On the other hand I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really hold it as a flaw because I understand why it was done and I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any other way to achieve the same thing Mark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s narrative just wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the same in 3rd person and if everything was in 1st person then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have no means to see what was happening on Earth nor what was set in motion to help Mark This is why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not knocking down a star Besides at least in this book I can clearly understand the reasoning behind it other books I read used the same kind of switch but with no apparent reason so\\xe2\\x80\\xa6brbrAs you can see the last two paragraphs would logically be flaws But once again I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care

       " 'Theres a comic strip I read about The Martian that says its a book for people who saw Apollo 13 and wished the whole movie had been more of the scene where the NASA team struggled to connect two pieces with a boxful of parts And while thats a little bit of a simplification its not really entirely wrong eitherbut it also doesnt convey just how much fun the book really is The Martian has a ridiculously simple premise due to a series of accidents an astronaut is believed dead and left stranded on Mars and the next expedition wont be coming for a long long time Weir strips The Martian down to its core making the book not about a spiritual journey not about making your peace with death but simply making it the tale of a man doing everything in his power to survive And what that everything involves is a lot  a LOT  of science From boiling the hydrogen out of compounds to making arable soil on Mars to tearing apart habitats for materials The Martian immerses us in our heros fight for survival counting on the innate appeal of watching people do things to keep us hooked And hooked I was Yes The Martian sometimes gets bogged down in minutiae and figures especially as it comes to the math behind some of the chemical work but it works for the book nicely making Marks survival feel like not the work of a writer but like the natural processes of an intelligent man Indeed one of the great pleasures of The Martian is that its a book about intelligent people acting intelligently rather than people doing dumb things or acting out of ignorance It makes for a really engaging and enjoyable survival tale one that keeps you gripped as much out of enjoyment of the problemsolving skills on display as your investment in the characters survival In other words its MacGyver on Mars and its as much fun as that sounds And if thats not enough its frequently funny often exciting and constantly evolving in in expend directions Its an uncommonly smart one an exciting adventure story and just a generally great read',\n",

       " 'I really enjoyed this book  It intrigued me because the focus was on making the math and logic work Rather than a maguffin that was able to solve all of the problems the protagonist went through challenges had to use his brain and needed to be very ingenious The progression through his time alone mentally as well as taskwise was complex and nuanced as well',\n",
       " 'Great story Really tickles the imagination Perfect for reading on the plane If your flight is more than 3 hours long you could likely finish before touchdown However if youve read lots of sci fi this will be a very familiar story Some readers used to harder sci fi may find this a bit too light Readers new to sci fi will find this to be a great introduction',\n",

       " 'A good not great book of technological savvy and survival The story and detailed portrait of what Martian exploration would look like is clear and interesting The flow of the book is good and it will be made into a good movie soon you can see the action very clearly But it lacks heart Its weakness is in the lack of human emotions and sensory detail',\n",
       " 'Andy Weir is the truth This is an altogether riveting novel Written by a different author this book had the potential of being a bore with its incorporation of such a vast amount of science technology engineering and math but in Weirs capable hands its a masterpiece of hard science fiction Matt Damon parenthetically is a perfect cast choice for the upcoming film adaptation',\n",

       " 'Brilliant book The only weakness which makes sense considering the authors selfdescribed geek status is the hackneyed way the individuals back on Earth are portrayed especially the PR rep for NASA The action on Mars is incredible and believe it or not the science is ALL REAL Highly recommended just hold your nose for the Earthbound stuff',\n",

       " 'Absolutely fabulous story An astronaut that gets stranded on Mars and needs to find a way to stay alive as time passes and supplies amp equipment run out or degrade Instead of giving you any summary of the rest of the story line Im going to talk about why its such a great book to read and leave all the cool funny suspenseful and dramatic details untouched so you can really enjoy them as you read it yourself I knew absolutely nothing about the story before reading it beyond what Ive just said in my second sentence above and I do believe it would make a huge difference My husband and boys all read this when I did and we were constantly laughing out loud or asking each other Where are you atwhats he doing right now My oldest is still reading it and Im finding my self enjoying the revisiting of the story as he passes each chapterbrbrAndy Weir has a very cool writing style It is different than a lot of other styles I have gotten used to and I found myself enjoying the change a lot which means he does it very well Hes really funny and it comes out in his main character in so many ways After the first few chapters you find yourself with a page turner that you hate to put down and cant wait to fall back into I actually paused at the last page of the last chapter thinking there was going to be more and when I returned to the story the next day with my feet curled under me on the couch I was heartbroken to find the next page was not the start of another chapter but the Thank you for reading screen It was like losing a best friend or a family member to find I had nothing else to read in the book well the interview with Weir at the end of the book was a nice bonus as I was desperate for more While others might think its a negative strike against a book for it to end while the reader thinks theres going to be more and it is in most other cases it wasnt in this book It could have ended at a lot of various different points without leaving the reader to feel like too many loose ends had been left He chose a good place to end it but the story was soooo good I would have eaten up 10 more chapters easily and then some Theres another whole book of real challenges and suspense he could write about after the point he ended this one at It didnt seem like he did that intentionally but I would love to read the next adventure picking up where he left off I kept telling my husband after I had finished it I miss my martian I was literally sad for a day or two wanting to hear the details of his next day and not being able to  LOLbrbrNow the science part Dont click away with a yawn looking for something else Andy Weirs writing will completely take you by surprise as you find out how much you enjoy understanding the finer scientific reasoning physics and chemistry behind things this astronaut can or cant do on Mars and following his logic as he tries to figure out ways to survive Almost everything the astronaut does is absolutely believable and his attitude reactions and emotions all ring true to the reader as something they themselves probably would think feel or do Its so down to earth but on Mars  ha ha that it makes it engaging Reading this story doesnt leave you in that fun what if wonderment state like some science fiction does with unbelievable circumstances or worlds that are not based in our reality Weir basis his entire story on our present reality and writes about the actual probable circumstances if this actually happened It leaves you thinking thats probably just what its like or would be like and you feel incredibly educated about the planet Mars a fresh wonderment all its own You find yourself more motivated to see the reallife discoveries mankind has about Mars in the future as well as our potential for space travel in general from a realistic point of view Has Weir found the magic formula to reignite the excitement and imagination of the American public once again for space travel I think sobrbrAs for reading about the physics or chemistry behind his adventures dont make the mistake of thinking it will be too boring or complex to enjoy Weir knows how to word things so that youre eyes dont glaze over and instead you find yourself understanding completely or quickly Googling something you want to know more about and never thought you would Thats something I found myself doing a LOT Thats pure inspiration and what makes Weir such a good writer He also lets the reader off the hook in so many places throughout the story with graceful andor funny transitions into laymens terms or explanations or by having the character admit he really doesnt understand the science behind something thats the other astronauts specialty and then he goes about talking plainly while you laugh at how simple to understand it really was Rather than struggling to understand the science he explains you find yourself enjoying it with his relaxed writing This character is a highly intelligent NASA astronaut and yet the writing without cutting too many corners makes you feel like youre on equal footing intellectually Whats really funny is the realization that mankind has created a lot of complicated lingo to communicate with in each of the different specialties of knowledge An efficiency necessity among equally trained individuals for sure but those who choose to speak their specialized lingo at all times unnecessarily alienate those outside their field When that same communication is put more simply its actually not that hard to understand at all Kudos to Weir for knowing this and humorously getting around itbrbrDont pass on this read Trust me you will love it and be glad to have read it',\n",

       " 'WOW  What a fantastic read and wild ride  I havent read this type of book in a long time  Id seen previews of the movie heard its supposed to be the best SYFY movie since original star wars movies  So I thought I had to read the book  And Im so thankful I made that decision  And thinking of Matt Damon as Mark Watney only made the read even better  With all the science in this book it should have been boring and tedious  But it was anything but  And thats because the characters are so well written and developed that this was a joy to read  Mark is a wise cracking sarcastic comedian  He manages to face and survive each death defying challenge with intelligence ingenuity and humor  His talents as a botanist and mechanical engineer literally save his life  The other characters truly enrich the story  You get the contrast of space politics trying to balance least case tragedy against honor and guts to do the right thing  This is a standup and cheer story of survival and comradeship  It also highlights and celebrates the US leadership in space exploration and technological development  This book is masterfully written  And it is obvious that the character of Mark Watney is very much like the author himself  No one can write this type of dialogue that doesnt himself express himself like Watney  A lot of the book is written in first person as Mark writes his logs of his actual actions through his struggle to survive  Then there are portions that are in third person to describe what is happening on Earth and by Watneys mission coworkers to help rescue him  If it sounds like Im gushing its because I literally couldnt recommend this book more highly  I LOVED it  I cant wait to see the movie  You must read this book  I certainly hope Weir is writing his next blockbuster',\n",

       " 'I started this book at the beginning of an International trip and finished it in just 2 or 3 days aided by jet lag which kept me awake during the nights I could not put it down some nights even though my eyes were burning and I needed to sleep It is oddly and unexpectedly fascinating and mesmerizing There is very little character development not much of a plot and limited dialogue since the majority of the action happens when Mark Watney the Martian is all alone on the red planet with no one to talk to And since hes basically talking to himself or writing updates in a diary he doesnt bother to try to make his conversations scintillating The first line of the novel which I will have to alter a bit to get it past the Amazon profanity filters is Im pretty much fckd and thats typical of the self talk we hear from Mark Watney Hes a science nerd not a witty articulate renaissance man and you cant help thinking that hes a clone of the author Andy WeirbrbrMark Watney has to figure out how to survive for 500 days until the next Mars mission arrives since he has been mistakenly left behind when his crew mates thought he was dead He approaches each problem as a science challenge  how to grow food how to create more water how to equip and drive the ATV thousands of miles to the rendezvous site and how to alter and repair equipment to suit his needs It sounds boring but somehow is fascinating Of course I skimmed over the technical details that I didnt understand but according to the author he went to great lengths to ensure that the science was accurate He even went back and corrected some sections which were initially released in serial fashion on his web site when his readers advised him of technical inaccuracies The author indicates in the final essay that he bungled his way into a revelation Science creates plot He didnt need to create artificial plot devices  just the act of figuring out how to survive the daily challenges of life on Mars until the next crew could rescue him was sufficient to create exciting and suspenseful actionbrbrThe book and the upcoming movie to be released in the next few days will also have the benefit of bringing more attention to the STEM Science Technology Engineering and Math curriculum in our schools Science and science nerds are cool and can accomplish anything ',\n",

passages Here are a few of my favoritesbr1 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFolks this is going to be the most ghetto spacecraft we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever built\\xe2\\x80\\x9dbr2 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trapped in a small square that smells like burnt arm hair\\xe2\\x80\\x9dbr3 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThats right Mars Im going to piss and sht on you Thats what you get for trying to kill me all the time\\xe2\\x80\\x9dbrbrAside from humor another thing this book has in abundance is technical detail It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough that Mark Watney fixes all of his problems but in his log entries he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to tell you exactly how he does it to a damned T Water regular stopped functioning He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you exactly why Want to know how to grow potatoes in a Martian habitat You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll learn Want to know exactly how many solar panels it takes to power two rovers You get the idea I think that the tech detail to story ratio in The Martian is tipped in favor of the tech detail I really enjoyed it at first when he first returns to the habitat as a solo crew member and works out how he can use every little thing to his advantage But as the story went on I was hoping for less of these details but no such luck The plethora of technical detail continues until the last few pages The plus side of all this is that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all interjected with his angry swearing and sarcastic brand of humor without which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d probably have glossed past these sections in boredombrbrSo while Watney is the main show of the book we do get interludes from his logs as the story breaks to the NASA folks in Houston and to the remaining crew members of the Hermes as they fly back to Earth thinking their fellow crew member is dead This was a welcome surprise because after several chapters of Mark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s logs I was ready for a break Despite how little page time each of the characters gets they all have their own distinct personalities The banter and debating between the folks at NASA is nearly as entertaining as Watney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commentarybrbrSomething else I noticed nearly halfway through reading the book Mark Watney seems to really hate Mars Yes I understand he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d trapped there and has reason to hate it but he never gives any indication that he was ever excited to be there in the first place Sure he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s there by himself and every circumstance in the world is trying to kill him but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mars Considering he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a scientist and astronaut you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d think being on another planet would be his living dream but he seems to have no sense of wonder at all He mentions Phobos only because he uses it to help navigate since compasses don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work on Mars and he refers to Deimos as a useless speck of sht Never once does the book even mention Olympus Mons the largest mountain in the solar system or Mariner Valley the massive canyon that runs for 4000 miles along the planet Even if the author had no intention of placing the story near these features wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t someone on Mars want to see them If I was trapped on Mars and thought I was going to die I would at least think \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdamn I really wanted to see the largest mountain in the known universe\\xe2\\x80\\x9dbrbrIn summary the Martian is a humorous and fairly entertaining book about survival on Mars As someone who loves to be pulled into strange alien settings when it comes to science fiction I was left disappointed here Also as someone who likes to be emotionally invested in the characters I read about I was disappointed there as well If you read this book without expecting those things I think you can still enjoy it It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very informative and very straightforward look at what a manned Mars expedition could really be like All the dangers of space travel mixed with the political red tape back on Earth tell me how much I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad I never wanted to be an astronaut I look forward to seeing one of the Masters of science fiction movies adapt this into a film Perhaps Ridley Scott can inject the story with a sense of awe and wonder that I hope to get from scifi For now I return to my normal scheduled reading Perhaps soon I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll poke my head back out of my hole and read another book all the kids are reading I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking at you Ready Player One',\n",

know this time I hesitated  Then Amazon was offering the ebook for cheap and as a bonus they were also offeringthrough Audible the audiobook with the Whispersync capability  I took that as a sign made the purchases and dug inbrbrAnd like my hip replacement surgery back in 2013 wished Id done so a lot soonerbrbrMark Watney is an astronaut on the Ares 3 Mars mission  It is Sol 6  the sixth day the crew was on the planets surface when a fierce sandstorm hit  The crew is given the word to scrub the mission and evacuate the planet  If they stayed through the sandstorm their ascent vehicle would be wrecked and they would be unable to leave  In the process of getting back to the ascent vehicle Watney is struck by a flying piece of equipment  His spacesuit is pierced and he cant get to the vehicle  An attempt is made to retrieve his body but the crew has to leave before they can get to him  They leave his corpse on the Martian surfacebrbrExcept as you might guess Watney wasnt dead  His suit was breached in such a way that the hole was plugged just right by the equipment that pierced it  He got back to the hab and the story takes off from therebrbrWatney is a botanist and an engineer  a convenient combination if youre going to be stranded on the surface of a planet all by yourself and youre trying to figure out how to survive until the next manned mission to Mars more than a year later  As a botanist you have a shot at figuring out how to feed yourself for over a year and as an engineer you have a shot at figuring out all the rest of the problems that you would encounter along the way  Where is the air going  to come from  Wheres the water going to come from  How am I going to make do with what I have  How am I going to get to the landing site of the next mission  And just how am I going to survive everything that Mars throws at mebrbrWhat follows is the story of one man against a planet  One man trying to survive anyway he can to get to go home  even when no one else knows hes alive  Its a fascinating look at what one ingenious person can do when the odds are against him  But lest you think that the entirety of this story follows Watney around on the surface of Mars trying to survive  well it doesnt  I will have to admit that I thought that was going to be the case and that it would be pretty boring  Then when I was least expecting it Weir does take us to Earth to follow the exploits of the people who are involved in trying to get Watney back home  once they find out that hes alive  The third leg of the bar stool is the crew of Ares 3  those folks who left Watney behindbrbrThis really is the story of how humanity can work together when it is targeted on a common goal  Its a celebration of how we really can accomplish things if we put away our petty differences and get down to the task at hand  Each leg on the aforementioned barstool has a role to play and each leg plays it well although as you might guess not without some difficultybrbrWatney is the picture of perseverance tackling anything and everything Mars throws at him  He does so with humor and sarcasm I frequently found myself laughing out loud when Watney went into humor mode  and it was often  But he was strong always strong even when he made a mistake that could have cost him dearly  The ground personnel on Earth worked like the personnel in those Apollo missions  sometimes flying by the seat of their pants with no clue how things were going to work out  And finally the Ares 3 crew voting to spend another year of their lives to go back and get their teammate fighting their own problems to get there and get the work done  Yes it does seem like Apollo 13 all over againbrbrThis is very much a hard science fiction story  Theres lots of science here  Weir did his research and uses it to explain through the logs entries that Watney makes just how Watney gets through every situation he finds himself in  Yep the grand tradition of the info dump is in full swing here and that may turn some people off  But this is science fiction in the original sense of the term  Its problemsolving science fiction and darn it even with all that its one compelling gripping story  I found myself caring very deeply about what was happening to Watney and I looked forward to how he was going to get out of each and every problem he found himself in  I read one quote that used the term MacGuyver on Mars  Yep that was it alrightbrbrRC Bray was probably the best narrator Ive heard to date in any audio book Ive listened to with the possible exception of Wil Wheaton narrating a John Scalzi novel  He was emotional vibrant and was never boring to listen to  He made Watneys jokes come alive  He was simply outstanding  Im sure some of that was the source material but the narrator still has to put hisher stamp on the book  Bray did an outstanding jobbrbrWhether you listen to or read this book in the traditional manner I think youll enjoy it  I know I did  And I think I may just pick up the next Weir novel when it comes out',\n",

       " 'This novel is a really terrific audiobook  It was exciting engaging suspenseful laughoutloud funny at times and thoroughly satisfying in the end  The reader was also the perfect voice  I remodel houses and I listen to audiobooks while I do it  A good audiobook will make me forget that Im even working this was truly great in that respect A lot of the recent acclaimed novels Ive listened to were just a waterfall of words gushing out of an authors mouth  Details in the beginning are superfluous in the end and have no lasting value to the story  Andy Weir didnt make this mistake which makes the book more enjoyable throughout the story builds from beginning to the end and its all good  There are moments when I literally laughed out loud the author seems to have truly enjoyed the story as he was writing it  This author also understands the importance of the hook  From the getgo you were involved and interested  So many of the popular books take 100 pages or three incredibly dull hours of audiobook to build to the first point of interest and this one didnt thankfully  If there were another book by this author I would get it in a heart beatbr  I only have two complaints which are both small and not really complaints  First there are passages that get very technical  The technical portions add to the realism but you have to pause and focus on the book to keep track of whats going on at those moments  If I were sitting still listening to the book this wouldnt be an issue but since I was trying to do other work to putting on baseboard trim at that point it was a little difficult to follow like being forced to do higher math in the middle of a TV show it can be done but it takes away some of the mindlessness of entertainment  The second complaint is that about half of the book has plot points that are eerily similar to the movie Red Planet  As that is one of my favorite movies I didnt mind the parallels but a couple hours in I was convinced that I was reading the book that the movie must have been based on  The second half of the book went in a mostly different direction and stepped out on its own but there are a number of similar plot elements that almost feel lifted from that terrific movie   not really a complaint so much as an observation   Get the book Its good  Youll enjoy it',\n",
